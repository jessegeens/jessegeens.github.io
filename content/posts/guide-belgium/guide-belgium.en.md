# Jesse's guide to Belgium :belgium:
Many of my friends regularly come to Belgium and ask me what they can see and eat here. Instead of always copy-pasting the same answer, I decided to write a small blogpost about it! I will highlight some famous Belgian dishes that you *must* try while you're here, as well as highlighting some things you can do in Belgium's largest and pretties cities.

**NOTE: this post is still a work in progress. Check back later for an updated version!**

## Belgium?!
Belgium is a tiny country in the middle of Western Europe. Our capital is Brussels, and lies right in the middle of the country. We have an extensive train network, so from Brussels you can reach almost any major destination in at most 1.5h. Paris, London and Amsterdam are also all only 1.5h away by high-speed train. 

Belgium is a *federated* country, so like the United States, it consists of multiple autonomous parts called the *regions* (actually, it's a *lot* more complicated, as we have seven parliaments and then also a provincial and municipal level, but I'll keep it short here). The north part of Belgium is called Flanders, which takes up around 60% of the population and the language here is Dutch. Then there is the Brussels-Capital region, which takes up around 10% of the population, and Brussels is officially bilingual (French-Dutch). Finally, there is the south part of the country called Walloonia. Here the main language is French, even though there is also a small part in the East that speaks German. 


## Belgian gastronomy
Us Belgians take great pride in only very few things. Mostly, these are our beers and our food. As you will notice, Belgians are a bit alcoholics. Below you can find ten dishes and some accompanying typical drinks that I think you should really try while you're here!

### Essential dishes in Belgium
1. Belgian beef stew (also called *stoofvlees* or *carbonade flamande*): this is considered our national dish and is usually made with brown beer
2. Videe (also called *koninginnenhapje* or *vol-au-vent*): sort of chicken meat with a nice sauce and always served with a pastry
3. Kip met appelmoes (chicken with apple mousse or *poulet a la compote* with fries)
4. Boulettes liÃ¨goises (sort of meatballs, but you will probably only find it in Walloonia or Brussels, not in Flanders)
5. Waffles: as a desert! There are two kinds of waffles that are popular in Belgium: the version from Brussels or the Version from LiÃ¨ge. LiÃ¨gois waffles are a bit heavier and have small clumps of sugar in them. They are usually served either without toppings or with chocolate on them. The Brussels version is much lighter and is often served with powdered sugar, ice cream or 

### Drinks
If there is one thing Belgium is *really* famous for, it's beers. And rightly so! A small warning though, our beers are very heavy on the alcohol (think around 8%). Here is a small list of some of my favourite beers:

1. Gouden carolus tripel
2. Cornet
3. Duvel
4. Chimay bleue (a brown beer)
5. Jupiler (pils)


While this may surprise you, we also have some other typical drinks! One of them is called jenever, it's a liquour of about 20% alcohol with a fruity taste. It comes in many different varieties (lemon, vanilla, cactus, apple, cuberdon, chocolate, ...) and it is typically drunk around the holidays. It's very good though!

## Belgian cities

### Brussels
Brussels (BXL) is by far my favourite city in Belgium. It is the capital and around one million people call it home. It is a geographically fairly large city and it is bilingual. Brussels is home to many things, such as NATO and the European Union. Brussels has a very extensive train network, as well as a metro system, trams, and a lot of buses. So, no need to Uber around! 

#### Major attractions
1. Grand place
2. Palais royal
3. Palais de justice
4. Mont des arts
5. Atomium
6. Basiliek van Koekelberg
7. European Quarter (EU Commission and European council)

### Ghent

### Bruges

### Antwerp

### LiÃ¨ge
