# The J-1 Program
The J-1 Program (officially called the BridgeUSA program) is an exchange program that lets foreign candidates explore the USA and gain experience in the country. 
There are many possibilities within the program, such as studying in the USA, doing an internship or traineeship, being an au-pair or even visiting as a professor.
Applications are taken through so-called visa sponsors, which perform a pre-selection of the candidates for the Department of State. They select suitable candidates (e.g. they have the necessary degree or experience) and refer them to the Department of State that gives out the J-1 visa.
