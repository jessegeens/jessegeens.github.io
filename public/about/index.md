# About me
I am a 23 year old software engineer, with a master's degree in Engineering Computer Science from the [University of Leuven](https://wms.cs.kuleuven.be/cs/english). My specializations lie in distributed systems (the topic I majored in) and privacy-enhancing technologies. I am also very interested in start-ups, entrepreneurship, investing and politics.
